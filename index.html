<p> My name is Dansel De Luna and I am a barista at Nature's Juice. I love playing league of legends and other types of MMORPGs. I am friendly and I am a passionate person. </p>

<h1> My Background </h1>
<p> I have a B.S. in Public Health from Cal State L.A. and graduated on December of 2016. I am currently working part time at a smoothie bar and am currently looking into pursuing a career in programming. </p>
<h1>Why did I decide to learn programming?</h1>
<p> I have always wondered about how websites functioned, how the internet works, what C++ is, and how to hack computer games. Programming deals with the computer, and that is something I love using. </p>
